    "The SAT is the most taken college admission test$^{1}$, with 2,136,539 students$^{2}$ from the class of 2018 taking the test. Out of 3,651,200 total students in the class of 2018 in the US$^{3}$, that's 59% of graduating seniors who took the SAT. Does the SAT need to focus on increasing its participation rates? Or, given that over a majority of high school students are now taking this test as a way to get into college, how are they performing? Is the rise in SAT test-takers contributing to the rise of students going to college?  \n",

    "#### The SAT and ACT datasets did not display normal distributions. \n",
    "- Across the board for participation rates and test scores, the distributions of the data tended to be bimodal or non-normal. That is, a majority of the data appeared at opposite ends of the distribution. For example, when observing the distribution of average SAT scores, students tended to perform either very poorly or very well. This is in contrast to a normal distribution where less students would have performed either very poorly or very well, and more students would have performed mediocrely. \n",

    "Let's take a closer look at the distriburions for Math and Reading scores, and Participation Rates for both tests in both years. \n",
    "- **Math**: In Math scores for both the SAT and ACT, students tended to perform very poorly. The distribution of scores are right skewed, meaning that a majority of the data appears on the left side of the distribution where the score range is lower. The range for Math scores in the SAT is 200 - 800. For students in the US, the maximum Math score achieved in 2017 was 651 and in 2018 was 655. Students performed closer to the minimum score than the maximum score. \n",

    "- **Reading**: In the Reading scores for the SAT in both years, the distribution of the data is bimodal. That is, students tended to perform either very poorly or very well. On the other hand, the ACT English scores in 2017 appears to be more evenly distributed but slightly skewed to the left. More students performed mediocrely, and only a few students performed very well and fewer performed very poorly. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **Participation Rates**: The distributions of the participation rates for the SAT in both years is bimodal, with a tendency for participation rates to be the far low end of the participation rates. A majority of states experienced extremely low participation rates on the SAT, and a few experienced extremely high participation rates. In contracts, the distribution of participation for the ACT in both years was also bimodal, but there were much more states that experienced higher participation rates than lower. \n",
    "\n",
    "**It does not make sense to conduct statistical inference** given these data specifically. The datasets for both tests provides data for all students in all states (and DC). Therefore, we are analyzing a population and not a sample. Statistical inference is conducted only when the data is a sampling of the population."

    "In 2018, 2.1 million students from the class of 2018 took the SAT -- the highest ever.$^{1}$ In fact, there was a 27% increase in participation rates from the previous year.$^{2}$ SAT participation rates are so high that as of 2018, the test holds the title for \"most widely used college admission test,\" beating the ACT where 1.91 million students took that test in the same year.$^{3}$  While the SAT can boast of this achievement, the data shows that there is a negative correlation between participation rates and test scores. That is, the higher the participation rate amongst all states and DC, the lower the average student test scores. This is alarming considering that high SAT scores are demanded by most universities and colleges. Contrary to the College Board's claim that the SAT offers \"greater access and opportunity\" for students who take their test, the more widely their test is offered, the higher the chances are of more students performing poorly. One notable example is Washington, DC, where students had among the highest participation rates of all states in 2017 - 2018, but earned the lowest test scores. Conversely, Minnesota had participation rates in the bottom 10 on a national scale in 2017-18, but earned the highest test scores. Taking a closer look at test scores, students were either performed very poorly or very well. But there were more students who performed poorly than well. If taking the SAT is a significant contributor to college acceptance, the SAT itself is posing a burden to students' access to college. Instead of focusing on increasing participation rates, the SAT show focus more test prep materials.  \n",

    "The College Board focusing on increasing participation rates is equivalent to the College Board assisting in  deterioration of test scores. There is a distinct negative correlation between participation rates and test scores, where the higher the participation rates, the lower the test scores (and vice versa). If the College Board decides to focus solely on increasing participation rates, thereby achieving an ideal of a 100% participation rate, a majority of US high schoolers will perform very poorly on the test.  \n",

    "**Recommendations**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Therefore in order to achieve sustainable growth and be a resource trusted by students nationwide (i.e., its primary customers), I recommend the following:  \n",
    "- Shift focus away from participation and more towards improving access to test prep resources. \n",
    "- Create better test prep material for states with highest participation rates, particularly in the East Coast where there is a concentration of states with high performance and low test scores. "
